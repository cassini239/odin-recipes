        <h2>It's not chicken, but it's good!</h2>
        <p>Tofu and Teriyaki just <strong><em>go</em></strong> together. It's crazy.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) package extra firm tofu, drained pressed, and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil (or high heat oil of choice)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper (or black pepper)</li>
            <h4>For the teriyaki sauce:</h4>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin or dry sherry</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chilled water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the crispy baked tofu, preheat the oven to 400° and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place the tofu into a medium bowl and add the soy sauce, oil, cornstarch, and pepper. Toss to coat the tofu.</li>
            <li>Arrange the tofu pieces in a single layer on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 30 minutes, turning halfway through, until browned and crispy.</li>
            <li>While the tofu bakes, prepare the sauce. Stir ¼ cup of water, brown sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sherry, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger together in small saucepan.</li>
            <li>Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the sauce to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat and allow it to simmer for 10 minutes, until reduced by about ⅓.</li>
            <li>Stir the chilled water and cornstarch together in a small bowl or cup. Stir the mixture into the sauce and allow it to simmer for about 1 minute more, until it thickens up a bit.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat.</li>
            <li>When the tofu is finished cooking, add it to the pot and stir to coat the tofu with sauce.</li>
            <li>Divide onto plates with rice and steamed veggies. Top with sesame seeds and scallions. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
